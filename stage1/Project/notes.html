    <h2>Lecture 1: The Basics of the web and HTML</h2>
    <h3>Part1: Technological empathy to understand what happens when we open a web page.</h3>
    <div>
      <b>Several important concepts about internet</b>
      <li><em>Web</em>: Web to connect different computers. Most famous one is <em>WWW</em> (World Wide Web).</li>
      <li><em>HTML</em>: Hyper Text Markup Language. Main part of WWW.</li>
      <li><em>urls</em>: What we can use it to access website.</li>
      <li><em>HTTP</em>: Hyper Text Transfer Protocal. How html file be tranfered and displayed.</li>
      <li><em>Web Application</em>: Applications used on web.</li>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>How these works?</b>
      <p>At first, user should use the browser, a web application, on his computer try to access a web site, which by entering
      urls in brower. And through web, by HTTP, the server will send us HTML files. So we can look these html files on our own
      computer through the brower.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>What make up HTML files</b>
      <p>There are almost four parts compose HTML files. They are:
      <li><em>Text Content: </em>Text strings what we see.</li>
      <li><em>Mark Up: </em>What a web page looks like.</li>
      <li><em>Reference to other documents: </em>Such like images, videos, and audios.</li>
      <li><em>Other Pages: </em>We all familiar with this. Through hyperlink we can jump to other pages.</li>

      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Part2: Learning some tags to create a simple html page</h3>
    <div>
      <b>Elements</b>
      <p>HTML files are made by various elements. <br>
        And normally elements are made by three parts, opening tag, content, closing tag. <br>
        However, some tags can also have attributes.
        And even there are some tags called void tag without content and closing tag. <br>
        There are some examples.
      </p>
      <p>
      <li><em>Normal: </em> &ltb&gt <b>Bold</b>; &ltem&gt <em>Emphasis</em>; </li>
      <li><em>With Attributes: </em> &lta href=url&gt <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Anchor</a> </li>
      <li><em>Void Tag:</em> &ltimg src=url&gt This image tag. <img src="https://www.uplabs.com/assets/integrations/udacity-92b3b2525603489c7c5f325491d0ff44652631210086bb2ab082b897b9b39da0.png" alt="Errors!">
      It's have no closing tag because has no content.</li>

      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>Inline & Block</b>
      <p>In addition to above variety, there are also a feature called <b>Block</b> is important. Block
      means a part of region divid with other parts. And we can change features of its looklike or something else.
      However, <b>Inline</b> is elements in a part of region or block. One easy way to discriminate them is to see
      will it change line, except &ltbr&gt element.
      Example:
      <li><em>Block: </em>&ltp&gt, &ltspan&gt, &ltdiv&gt</li>
      <li><em>Inline: </em>&ltem&gt &ltbr&gt</li></p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>HTML file detail</b>
      <p><li><em>Doctype</em>: There is a line to declare document type. Normally, HTML.</li>
      <li><em>Head</em>: This part will describe the layout of this html file. It can have CSS, Javascript. </li>
      <li><em>Body</em>: Main part of a html file. The contents that we want show to other people will be there.</li>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>Summary</b>
      <p>-Normally, we go to WWW access HTML files through HTTP protcol. <br>
      -HTML is made up by Text Content, Mark Up, and Reference to various documents and other pages. <br>
      -HTML has many elements which have several categories. Like void tag, tag with attributes, and incline and block. <br>
      -HTML has two parts. Head to tell the design. And body to tell the content. <br>

  <div>
    <h2>Lesson 2: The structure of HTML</h2>
    <div>
      <b>Funny analogy of HTML, CSS, and Javascript</b>
      <p>If a webpage file is an house, then we can look <em>HTML</em> as it's walls and
      fundation. In other words, it forms the structure of webpage. <em>CSS</em>, which
      decides the style of the webpage, just like how we choose our room color and
      decorations. Last, <em>Javascript</em> like the controller in our house. It manages
      the interactions of the webpage.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>Chrome developer tool</b>
      <p>If we use chrome, we can access some very covenient tool for our development.
      For shortcut, we can press Shift + Ctrl + i to call developer tool. From this tool,
      we could see structure of webpage very easily, and we can also change some features
      by our own to look what will happen.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>DOM (Document Object Model)</b>
      <p>
        DOM means tree-like structure of page. Just like in HTML files, we can see
        many elements are included in other elements, which also are included by other elements.
        There are many levels of elements, and you can draw a tree by their relations.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <b>Everywhere boxes, why box</b>
      <p>At first, why we use boxes to represent elements is that in this way it will be
      easy to rearrange the style and layout of your webpage. Because the concept
      of box is so important that we need learn how to boxify a design. Before you
      type your code, you need draw boxes to the ordered design and get the structure.
      Then type your code.</p>

  <div class="lecture">
    <h2>Lecture 3: CSS style and HTML structure</h2>
    <div class="concept">
      <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</b>
      <p>CSS are the codes to control "Style" of HTML elements. It has two parts:
         the selector part to select elements; the declaration to declare the property and its value.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <b>OH: span & div, class & id</b>
      <p>
        The main difference between span and div two elements is that span is inline
        element, but div is block element. In othe words, div will take whole width, while
        span just take the area it spans. So span is used to adjust more dedicted style,
        whereas div is used to control layout style.
      </p>
      <p>
        The differece between id and class is that id always be used to a unique element,
        while class is used to a group of elements. So id are very convenient to be used
        as bookmarks of content.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <b>Box model</b>
      <p>
        Box model of HTML has four areas. The core one is called content, which
        has the main contents. Then the second one is called padding, which like
        shield to protect content and clear area. More outer one is border area,
        which is boder of box and has the same color with box. The last one is called
        margin, which decied the space between boxes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <b>How to make a good boxes layout</b>
      <p>
        Because box has many properties, so it is very hard to get right size of a box.
        We can resolve this in two ways.
        <ol>
          <li>Set size in terms of percentage.</li>
          <li>Set box-sizing property to border-box for every elements.</li>
        </ol>
        Sometiems, we can also use flex box layout to achieve a good layout.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <b>Code, Test, Refine</b>
      <p>
        For a big picture flow, when we write HTML file, we need do several steps.
        <ol>
          <li>Look for natural boxes from design.</li>
          <li>Look repeated styles by semantic elements.</li>
          <li>Write HTML.</li>
          <li>Apply styles (From big to small).</li>
          <li>Fix things.</li>
        </ol>
        Normally, we will come cross 3 to 5 several times to make a page look good.
