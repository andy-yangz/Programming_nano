<h1>My HTML notes</h1>

<h2>Part1: Technological empathy to understand what happens when we open a web page.</h2>
<h3>Several important concepts about internet</h3>
<li><b>Web</b>: Web to connect different computers. Most famous one is <b>WWW</b> (World Wide Web)</li>
<li><b>HTML</b>: Hyper Text Markup Language. Main part of WWW.</li>
<li><b>urls</b>: What we can use it to access website.</li>
<li><b>HTTP</b>: Hyper Text Transfer Protocal. How html file be tranfered and displayed</li>
<li><b>Web Application</b>: Applications used on web.</li>
<br>
<b>How these works?</b>
<p>At first, user should use the browser, a web application, on his computer try to access a web site, which by entering
urls in brower. And through web, by HTTP, the server will send us HTML files. So we can look these html files on our own
computer through the brower.</p>

<b>What make up HTML files</b>
<p>There are almost four parts compose HTML files. They are:
<li><b>Text Content.</b>Text strings what we see.</li>
<li><b>Mark Up.</b>What a web page looks like.</li>
<li><b>Reference to other documents.</b>Such like images, videos, and audios.</li>
<li><b>Other Pages</b>We all familiar with this. Through hyperlink we can jump to other pages.</li>

<h2>Part2: Learning some tags to create a simple html page</h2>
<b>Elements</b>
<p>HTML files are made by various elements. <br>
  And normally elements are made by three parts, opening tag, content, closing tag.
  However, some tags can also have attributes.
  And even there are some tags called void tag with out content and closing tag. <br>
  There are some examples.
</p>
<p><li><b>Normal: </b> &ltb&gt <b>Bold</b>; &ltem&gt <em>Emphasis</em>; </li>
<li><b>With Attributes</b> &lta href=url&gt <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Anchor</a> </li>
<li><b>Void Tag:</b> &ltimg src=url&gt This image tag. <img src="https://www.uplabs.com/assets/integrations/udacity-92b3b2525603489c7c5f325491d0ff44652631210086bb2ab082b897b9b39da0.png" alt="Errors!">

<b>Inline & Block</b>
<p>In addition to above variety, there are also a feature called <b>Block</b> is important. Block
means a part of region divid with other parts. And we can change features of it's look like or something else.
However, <b>Inline</b> is elements in a part of region or block. One easy way to discriminate them is to see
will it change line, except &ltbr&gt element.
Example:
<li><b>Block:</b>&ltp&gt, &ltspan&gt, &ltdiv&gt</li>
<li><b>Inline:</b>&ltem&gt &ltbr&gt</li></p>

<li>2. Head: This part will describe the layout of this html file. It can have CSS, Javascript. </li>
<li>3. Body: Main part of this html file. What we want show other people will be there.</li>
